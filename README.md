# M1 - Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration
Semiconductor packaging is a process of enclosing a fabricated semiconductor chip(die) in a protective case.
Reasons for doing so - 
* Protect it from the physical damage.
* Provides electrical connections between the microscopic circuits on the chip and the real world.
* Manages heat generated by the chip during operation.<br>
NEEDED WHY?  --> Bare silicon dies are fragile and cannot be directly used in the devices.
* Protection of chip - from physical damage ,moisture,dustand communication. 
* Electrical connections -done between the microscopic bonding pads on the chip and the larger pins or the balls used to connect to a circuit board.
* Heat dissipation - to prevent the overheating during operation.
* Mechanical support - provides a stable from for assembly into devices.
* Standardization - defines the sizer, pin count, and the layout for the compatibility.
<br><br>
The key Functions of semiconductor package are:

* Protection from external environmental (physical/ mechanical damage, humidity, corrosion/ contaminants & chemical damage and ESD)
* Electrical connectivity between the die and the external environment via leads (pins, balls or lands)
* Mechanical support and connection of the die to the system
* Thermal dissipation to conduct heat away from the die

## <u>M1-3 - Evolving Package Architectures - From Single Chip To Multi-Chip Modules</u>
### <u>Classification and Anatomy of Semiconductor Packages</u>
The various types of semiconductor packages can be broadly grouped into two main categories:
  - Conventional Packages
  - Wafer-Level Packages

In <b><u>Conventional Packaging</u></b>, the wafer is sawed into dice before the chip is packaged.<br>In <b><u>Wafer-Level Packaging</b></u> involves a part, or all, of the packaging process being performed at the wafer level before proceeding with wafer sawing.

### <u>Evolution of Package Architectures</u>
1. <b>Single-Chip Packages</b>
- Traditional packaging method contains one silicon die per package. Examples: DIP, QFP, BGA.
- Simple, cost-effective, but limited in performance and integration.

2. <b>System-in-Package (SiP)</b>
- Multiple dies integrated into a single package. Enables compact systems with diverse functionalities. Examples: Micro-Controller, Memory, RF, etc
- Ideal for smartphones, wearables, and IoT devices.

3. <b>Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs)</b>
- Multiple dies placed side-by-side or stacked within one package. Dies may be from different process nodes or vendors.
- Offers high bandwidth, low latency, and better power efficiency. Used in high-performance computing, AI accelerators, and servers.

4. <b>2.5D Packaging</b>
- Uses an interposer (usually silicon) to connect multiple dies.
- Improves signal integrity and power delivery. Common in GPUs and data center chips.

5. <b>3D Packaging</b>
- Dies are stacked vertically using Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs).Saves space and boosts performance.
- Ideal for memory integration (e.g., HBM with processors).<br><br>

**Why This Evolution Matters**
- <b>Performance Boost</b>: Shorter interconnects mean faster communication.
- <b>Power Efficiency</b>: Reduced parasitics and better thermal management.
- <b>Form Factor Reduction</b>: Smaller, thinner devices.
- <b>Heterogeneous Integration</b>: Mix logic, memory, analog, and RF in one package.<br><br>

Depending on the medium of the package, packages can be further categorized into:
  - **Leadframe Based Packages**
    - <b>DIP</b>: Traditional, with wirebonds and external leads
    - <b>QFN</b>: Compact with exposed thermal pads
    - <b>Leadframe CSP & QFP</b>: Scaled for density and SMT

  - **Laminate Based Packages**
    - <b>PBGA</b>: Wirebonded to laminated substrates
    - <b>Flip Chip (PBGA)</b>: Superior signal and thermal performance
    - <b>LGA, FCCSP</b>: Common in modern devices

  - **Advanced Substrates Based Packages**
    - <b>2D</b>: Dies placed side-by-side on the same substrate
    - <b>2.1D</b>: Adds RDL for better routing
    - <b>2.3D</b>: Uses organic interposers
    - <b>2.5D</b>: Silicon interposer for high-speed interconnects (e.g.: CoWoS) Semiconductor Packages<br>

## <u>M1-4 - Interposers, RDLs And 2.5D/3D Packaging Approaches</u>
## <u>Redistribution Layers (RDL)</u>

<b>RDLs (Redistribution Layers)</b> is a metal layer added on top of a die or wafer to reroute the I/O pads to new locations. This enables more flexible bump layouts, especially important for fan-out packages or wafer-level chip scale packaging (WLCSP).
![Package_Interposers_RDLs](./docs/images/Screenshot_612.png)

### Application
  - Fan-out wafer-level packaging (FO-WLP, FO-BGA)
  - Panel-level packaging (PLP)
  - Multi-die integration
  - System-in-Package (SiP)

### Advantages
  - Allows larger bump pitch for finer pad layouts
  - Reduces package size and thickness
  - Enables multi-chip placement and interconnect on a single substrate

### <u>Interposers</u>
An interposer is a passive or active layer inserted between the die and the substrate, acting as an intermediate routing interface. It enables dense signal routing, power delivery, and die-to-die interconnect.

  - <b>Types</b>:
    - Silicon
    - Organic
    - Glass

  - <b>Functions</b>:
    - Enables fan-out packaging and improves signal routing flexibility
    - Routes signals between multiple dies (e.g., chiplets)
    - Provides thermal expansion management
    - Enables high bandwidth communication
     
  - <b>Passive vs Active Interposers</b>:
    - <b>Passive</b>: No logic, just routing and vias
    - <b>Active</b>: Includes power delivery, clocking, or even memory logic<br><br>

### <u>2.5D/3D Integration</u>
  - <b>2.5D</b>:
    - Multiple dies (e.g., CPU + HBM) placed side-by-side on a common interposer.
    - Interposer provides connectivity, not the substrate directly. Popular in HPC and AI (e.g., AMD Instinct, NVIDIA GPUs with HBM).
    - Structure: Multiple dies placed on a shared interposer.
    - Benefits: High bandwidth, low latency, and heterogeneous integration.
    - Example: AMD’s chiplet-based CPUs.
  - <b>3D</b>:
    - Dies are stacked vertically, interconnected through Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs). 3D NAND, HBM memory stacks, logic-on-logic stacking.
    - Structure: Multiple dies placed on a shared interposer.
    - Benefits: High bandwidth, low latency, and heterogeneous integration.

### <u>Introduction to a Package Manufacturing Unit (ATMP)</u>

The ATMP process involves four core activities-
  - Assembly
  - Testing
  - Marking
  - Packaging<br>
The ATMPs could be OSATs (like ASE, Amkor, TATA etc.) or in-house ATMPs of IDMs (like Intel, Samsung, Micron) or Foundries (like TSMC, Samsung Foundry)<br><br>

### <u>Layout of an ATMP Unit</u>
![Typical_ATMP_Layout](./docs/images/Screenshot_617.png)


  1. <b>Material Preparation and Storage</b>
    - Incoming Wafers, Substrates, Leadframes, Mold Compounds, Consumables
  2. <b>Processing Zone (Clean Room: ISO Class 6 & 7)</b>
    - Major activities - 
      - Die Attach & Mount
      - Wire or Flip-Chip Bonding
      - RDL formation
      - Encapsulation / molding
  3. <b>Testing Area</b>
    - Electrical Tests
    - Burn-in Test
    - Reliability chamber testing
  4. <b>Warehouse</b>
    - Storage of packaged ICs

## <u>M2-2 - Wafer Pre-Preparation - Grinding And Dicing</u>
This section explained the wafer preparation process inside an ISO Class 7 cleanroom of an ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging) facility. 
![Wafer_Grinding_Dicing](./docs/images/Screenshot_618.png)

  1. <b>Incoming Wafer Carrier</b>: Wafers arrive in a protective carrier that ensures they remain uncontaminated before entering the processing line.
  2. <b>Wafer Inspection</b>: The wafers are visually and optically inspected for surface defects, contamination, or damage before further processing.
  3. <b>Wafer Front Tape Lamination</b>: A protective tape is laminated on the front (device side) of the wafer to protect it during subsequent processes like grinding and dicing.
  4. <b>Wafer Backside Grinding</b>: The wafer’s backside is ground using a rotating grinding wheel to reduce the wafer thickness from the ~700um to around 200um and enable better thermal performance and flexibility for final packaging.
  5. <b>Tape Frame Mounting to Wafer Backside</b>: After grinding, the wafer is mounted on a ring frame using an adhesive tape. This stabilizes the wafer and keeps individual die in place during dicing.
  6. <b>Wafer Dicing</b>:<br>
      - <b>Laser Grooving</b>: Precision laser cuts grooves along scribe lines to weaken the wafer structure.<br>
      - <b>Blade Dicing</b>: A high-precision blade is then used to physically dice the wafer into individual dies or chips.

## <u>M2-3 - Wire Bond Packaging - Die Attach To Molding</u>
![Wire_Bond_Packaging](./docs/images/Screenshot_625.png)

1. <b>Die Attach</b>: The individual (die) is attached to a substrate or lead frame using epoxy. The Epoxy is dispensed onto the die in some pattern to avoid any voids during attach. (Pattern complexity vs. speed of processing trade-off). The die is picked up by the pick-up head, and placed on the Die Attach Film (DAF).
2. <b>Curing</b>: The die-attached unit is subjected to a heating process to cure the epoxy, ensuring a strong and stable bond between the die and the substrate.
3. <b>Wire Bonding</b>: Fine gold or aluminum wires are bonded between the die and the package substrate pads using thermal and ultrasonic energy. Steps -<br>
      1. Formation of a ball bond using an EFO (Electronic Flame-Off) spark
      2. Bonding the ball to the die pad (using pressure, vibration, heat)
      3. Creating a wire loop
      4. Forming a crescent bond on the substrate side
4. <b>Molding (Transfer Molding)</b>: A mold compound is injected to encapsulate the wire-bonded die, providing protection from environmental damage and mechanical stress. Resin flows uniformly to cover the entire chip.
5. <b>Marking (Laser)</b>: Laser marking is used to engrave identification codes, logos, or batch numbers on the molded package surface.
6. <b>Singulation (Dicing Blade)</b>: The molded wafer is cut into individual units (ICs) using a dicing blade. A thinner blade is typically used to minimize chipping and maximize precision.

## <u>M2-4 - Flip Chip Assembly - Bump Formation And Underfill</u>

Flip chip packaging enhances electrical performance and I/O density by mounting the die face-down on the substrate.
![FlipChip_Packaging](./docs/images/Screenshot_626.png)

1. <b>Bump Formation on Silicon (Si)</b>: Solder bumps are created on the die. The bumps are then reflowed to form strong electrical and mechanical connections.
2. <b>Chip Flip and Placement</b>: The chip is flipped upside down. Flux is dispensed on to the substrate to aid solder wetting. Solder balls are aligned with the substrate’s bond pads.
3. <b>Solder Reflow</b>: The chip is heated so that the solder balls melt and bond with the substrate.
4. <b>Flux Cleansing</b>: The excess residual flux is removed using solvent spray to prevent corrosion.
5. <b>Underfill Dispensing</b>: Underfill material is applied to improve mechanical strength and thermal conductivity between the die and substrate.
6. <b>Underfill Cure</b>: Heated to cure the underfill.
7. <b>Molding</b>: A protective mold compound is applied.
8. <b>Marking</b>: Laser marking is done for identification (part number, lot, batch, date of manufacture etc.) and traceability.
9. <b>Ball Mounting and Reflow</b>: Solder balls are mounted on the substrate. A final reflow process ensures firm attachment of solder balls.

## <u>M2-5 - Wafer Level Packaging And Conclusion</u>
Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) is a technique where the entire packaging process is done at the wafer level, before dicing and offers smaller size, and lower cost.  
There are two main types of WLP -
  - <b>Fan-in WLP (FI-WLP)</b>: I/O pads are redistributed within the die area to match the solder bumps.
  - <b>Fan-out WLP (FO-WLP)</b>: Uses RDLs to extend the I/O pads beyond the die area, enabling higher I/O density.

### <u>FO-WLP Process</u>
![WLP](./docs/images/Screenshot_629.png)
1. <b>Reconstitution Process</b>: Diced Wafer is taken. Then, known-good dies are picked and placed onto a temporary carrier. Then, molding process is done to form a single reconstituted wafer after releasing the carrier.
2. <b>RDL (Redistribution Layer) Preparation</b>: Dielectric & Metal layers are deposited on to the reconstituted wafer and patterned. Multiple RDL layers are patterned to form the final RDL, similar to the metallization stages in FEOL/ CMOS facbrication.
3. <b>Solder Ball Attach</b>: Solder Balls are mounted on the final RDL pads to enable surface mounting.
4. <b>Laser Marking and Singulation</b>: Each packaged die is marked and the reconstituted wafer is diced (singulated) into individual packages.

# <u>M4 - Ensuring Package Reliability: Testing and Performance Validation</u>

## <u>M4-1 - Introduction to Package Testing and Electrical Functionality Checks</u>

In semiconductor packaging, reliability isn't just a goal—it's a necessity.ICs are tested at multiple points during the manufacturing process to ensure they meet performance, reliability, and functionality requirements. Testing takes place both at the foundry and at OSAT facilities.This phase involves rigorous procedures such as thermal cycling, drop tests, electrical continuity checks, and accelerated aging simulations. By identifying potential failure modes early, engineers can refine materials, design, and assembly processes to deliver robust, high-performance packages that meet industry standards and customer expectations.
![Package_Testing_1](./docs/images/Screenshot_630.png)

### <u>Foundry Testing Stages</u>
Foundry testing is a critical part of semiconductor fabrication, ensuring that wafers and individual dies meet stringent quality and performance standards before packaging and deployment. Key Stages - 
  - <b>1. Front-End Manufacturing</b>
      - Involves fabrication of integrated circuits on silicon wafers.
      - Leads to fine tuning of the Process parameters to improve yield, reduce IDDQ/ leakage and improve speed/ performance.

  - <b>2. Wafer Probe Test</b>
      - Wafer is mounted on a probe station and a probe card with makes contact with the bond pads or bump pads of each die.
      - An ATE can now send test patterns to mark the die as good or bad.

### <u>OSAT Testing Stages</u>
  - <b>1. Wafer Sorting</b>
      - Dies are sorted based on probe test results.
      - Only functional dies proceed to packaging.

  - <b>2. Package Manufacturing</b>
      - Functional dies are packaged

  - <b>3. Package Testing</b>
      - Conducted in ISO Class 6/7 cleanroom zones
      - Testing includes:
        - AOST (Assembly Open and Short Test): Shorts/ Opens in Packages
        - Burn-in Test: Elevated temperature and voltage and power cycling are applied to accelerate ageing to catch early failures.
        - Final Test: Validate the electrical performance of the packaged IC across temperature and voltage corners and ensure it meets the datasheet specifications.
    
        ![Package_Testing_2](./docs/images/Screenshot_631.png)

  - <b>4. System Level Testing (SLT)</b>
      - Testing is performed in conditions that closely mimic real-world system operation. SLT verifies how a chip behaves when it runs actual software or firmware inside a system-like environment.<br><br>

    <b>Processing Zone (Clean room: ISO class 6 & 7)</b>: This area handles initial packaging steps in a controlled environment. Key activities include die bonding, wire or flip-chip bonding, encapsulation, and RDL (Redistribution Layer) formation. Inspection is integral to the manufacturing process to ensure quality. Packages are loaded onto a tray after singulation, as shown in the image with a tray of individual packaged chips.<br>
    - <b>Testing Area (Electrical, burn-in, and reliability chamber tests)</b>: This area focuses on validating the packaged chips. The process involves - 
      - <b>AOST (Assembly Open and Short Test)</b>: Checks for open circuits and short circuits on the package board, using a package socket.
        ![Package_Testing_3](./docs/images/Screenshot_632.png)


## <u>M4-2 - Reliability and Performance Testing of Semiconductor Packages</u>

### <u>Burn-in and Final Test</u>

  - <b>1. Burn-In Test</b>
    - Burn-in testing is a reliability screening process used in semiconductor manufacturing to identify early-life failures in integrated circuits. By subjecting devices to elevated temperatures and voltages for extended periods, this test accelerates aging and stress conditions that mimic real-world usage. The goal is to ensure only robust, defect-free chips move forward in the production pipeline, enhancing long-term performance and reducing field failures.
    - Burn-in testing is a reliability screening process where semiconductor devices are exposed to elevated temperatures, voltages, and operating conditions for an extended period to accelerate aging and failure mechanisms.
    - It is used to identify and eliminate early-life failures (also called "infant mortality") in ICs before they are shipped to end users.
![Package_Testing_4](./docs/images/Screenshot_633.png)

  - <b>2. Final Test (FT)</b>: Its purpose is to verify that each integrated circuit (IC) meets all functional and performance specifications before shipment. Final Test is the last major electrical test phase after the semiconductor die has been packaged.
    - It verifies that the packaged device meets all functional, parametric, and performance specifications before it is shipped to customers.
    - It is typically performed by OSATs (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test providers) or in-house test facilities.

  - <b>Step 5 : Create Bond pads on Die and Substrate<b>
    - Draw a small rectangle and configure its size to to that of the die pad (0.2mm x 0.2mm). We will place the first Die Pad at the co-ordinates (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) so that it sits on top of the die and is at one of the edges.
    - Set the thickness to 5 microns (0.005mm)
    - Similarly, draw a small rectangle and configure its size to to that of the substrate bond pad (0.2mm x 0.2mm).
    - We will place this Substrate Bind Pad at the co-ordinates (0.2, -0.7, -0.1) so that it sits aligned to the Die bond pad created in the previous step, and also on top of the substrate.
    - Set the substrate bond pad thickness to 10 microns (0.010mm)
